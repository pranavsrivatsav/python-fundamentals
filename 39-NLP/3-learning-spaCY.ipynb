    "##### NLP\n",
    "- NLP is processing the input to process the text from the strict specs of a language.\n",
    "- In NLP, we try to gather all the possible units to place the input in a structure, that can be understood by more intelligent language models to weave their magic with this derived structure. \n",
    "- It performs an array of functions which includes:\n",
    "    - NER (Named Entity Recognition)\n",
    "    - syntax parsing\n",
    "    - POS\n",
    "    - Text categorization\n",
    "\n",
    "##### NLU\n",
    "- NLU is an attempt to humanize the language, trying to understand the language from a more human point of view.\n",
    "- It performs functions like:\n",
    "    - semantic parsing (understanding the context)\n",
    "    - question & answering (important in bots)\n",
    "    - sentiment analysis\n",
    "    - paraphrasing\n",
    "    - summarization\n",

    "#### SPACY Intro\n",
    "- What is spaCY?\n",
    "    - It is a python framework used to implement NLP.\n",
    "- why spaCY?\n",
    " - It comes with off the shelf models that are quick and precise, we as a developer don't need to tweak too much to get the best performance out of it.\n",
    " - It can use the latest transformer models.\n",
    " - Easier to perform custom trainer relative to other NLP frameworks\n",
    " - It is scalable, i.e it works well with real world data that are large in nature and are ever growing.\n",
